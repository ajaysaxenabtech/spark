• SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process) is a core component of banking supervision in the EU.
• Objective: To assess the risks banks face and ensure they have adequate strategies, processes, and capital to manage these risks.
• Our POD supports SREP by:
    - Delivering business and functional specifications for regulatory templates (e.g., DWF Asset, Branches Asset, Datamart Asset).
    - Building and maintaining data assets for SREP requirements.
    - Ensuring quality and timely delivery of SREP disclosures in alignment with other regulatory reports.
• Focus on collaboration across finance, risk, and compliance teams to support prudential supervision.
